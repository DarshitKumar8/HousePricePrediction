# HousePricePrediction

## Overview

The Bangalore House Prices Prediction project uses machine learning to predict house prices in Bangalore. The dataset used contains features such as location, size, total square feet, price, and other relevant details of properties. The workflow includes feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, outlier removal, and building various machine-learning models to improve the accuracy of predictions.

### Key Features
1. Feature Engineering: Transformation of raw features into more meaningful representations to improve model performance.
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Applied to reduce the number of input variables to avoid overfitting.
3. Outlier Removal: Used to improve the robustness and generalization of the model by eliminating extreme data points.
4. Machine Learning Models: Various algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., are applied to predict house prices.

### Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values
- Remove outliers to ensure data quality
- Perform feature scaling

2. Feature Engineering:
- Create new features from existing data (e.g., extracting house age, and room-to-area ratio)

3. Dimensionality Reduction:
- Apply techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature set while retaining important information.

4. Modeling:
Various machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated. This includes:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Gradient Boosting
